# readcache

`readcache` is a module to keep the contents of a file cached in memory until
it's modified. This is done by comparing the file's `fs.Stats.mtime`.

Originally meant to be used with JSON files, but anything else will do. It
will save you a bunch of `fs.readFile` until it's actually necessary, and
it's less "persistent" than loading JSON files using `require`.

## Installation

Using npm:

```
npm install readcache
```

## Reference

### readcache.readfile (path, [options], [callback])

Gets the contents of the file at `path`.

If the file is not cached yet, or if the file has been modified since the time
it was cached, the file will be read and its contents cached. Otherwise, you
will get the cached contents.

```js
var readcache = require('readcache');

readcache('/path/to/file', function (err, data, stats) {
    console.log(data); // Contents of the file
    console.log(stats); // { "hit": false, "mtime": 1439974339996 }
        
    // The file is cached now, so this time the contents will be coming from 
    // memory, instead of reading the file again
    readcache('/path/to/file', function (err, data, stats) {
        console.log(stats); // { "hit": true, "mtime": 1439974339996 }
    });
});
```
