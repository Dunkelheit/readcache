# readcache

`readcache` is a module to keep the contents of a file cached in memory until
the file is modified -- at that point, the file will be read again and cached
until the next time it's modified.

## Installation

Using npm:

```
npm install readcache
```

## Usage

Read a file:

```js
var readcache = require('readcache');

readcache('/path/to/file', function (err, data, stats) {

    console.log(data); // Contents of the file
    
});
```
